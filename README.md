An Android App by Team SuperSaiyans
1 Application supports two resolutions (Screen sizes and densities)  
2 Each activity and fragment has a correcponding java file in user interface package in which each UI object is represented as    an instance variable with input/output  statements setup to read/write values as needed. 
3 Intents are setup to enable navigation between activities or fragments.   
4 For Storage, database schema is adequately designed using rules of normalization. 
5 All entities are adequately setup with encapsulation and Object Oriented Design Guidelines. Abstract classes and Interfaces     are used necessarily. 
6 Web Services are implemented for local and remote use. 
7 Class Diagram and supporting Documentation for design are clearly described.
8 Exception Handling and some self healing is planned.  
9 Application design has a tiered approach for ui, database, services, model or object layer etc.
